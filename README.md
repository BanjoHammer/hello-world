First repository to get my feet wet

For some time now I've been thinking I need to learn to code.  The more I see, hear, and think about it, the clearer the value becomes.
There are a lot of wonderful tools, ideas, and applications that others have developed, both simple and complex, that I have relied on to help me at work and at home.  But I can't help thinking if I understood some of it, knew how it worked, knew how to make things work for me, I could be a little better off.  And maybe I could contribute to the work of others as well.  There's the old saying, give a man to fish, feed him for a day, etc etc.  Let's just say, I'd like to learn to fish.
